# Xray-Image-Report-Generation-Using-GenAI
This repository contains two deep learning models:

1. X-ray Report Generator â€“ Automatically generates diagnostic captions from chest X-ray images using a CNN + RNN architecture.
2. Fracture Classifier â€“ Classifies X-ray images for fracture detection using a CNN-based model.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Sources

X-ray Report Generator: Dataset sourced from MIMIC-CXR or similar public datasets with X-ray images and corresponding radiology reports.
Fracture Classifier: Based on curated datasets from platforms like Kaggle focused on bone X-rays and fracture classification tasks.

ðŸ§° Implementation Highlights

X-ray Report Generator (xray_report_gen.ipynb):

CNN: Feature extraction from X-ray images.
RNN (LSTM/GRU): Generates medical reports from image features.
Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and tokenizer for text.
Output: Radiology report predictions in natural language.

Fracture Classifier (Frac_classify.ipynb):

CNN Architecture: Custom layers for feature extraction and classification.
Preprocessing: Image augmentation and normalization.
Output: Predicts fracture vs. non-fracture class labels.
